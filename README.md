# Beginners_with_elixir
A tutorial for total beginners using Elixir

## What is this ?

That course is aimed at total beginners in code. We will help you to write code and understand how it works. If you are a programmer that know other languages, then that course was not written for you. Of course you can read it. But keep in mind that it will probably cover things that you knew.

## How much time will it take?

It depends of a lot of things. The thing we want to emphasize is that it is different for everyone. Take your time to understand each lesson. The lessons are aimed at taking you a week approximately, but you can be quicker or slower. This is not really a problem. Just keep going and try to not stop in the middle.

## What do i need to know ?

Nothing. This course is aimed at total beginners. We only assume that you know some basic command line command, but we also provide a lesson about them (Appendix A, to steal from LPTHW ?).

## How to use that course

Just follow each lessons in order. They are meant to build on the previous one.

Each part will follow a simple organisation.
First a small introduction to what we are going to do in the chapter.
Then a part named **Quick and Dirty**, that will ask to type some command or do something. *Type that exactly. By hand. You have to type everything.* I know you will want to copy the code and paste it. It would be counter productive. The goal of that part is to make you see the effect of what you type and to give you some basic knowledge of typing code. You have to type code to learn how to do it. So please *type everything!*

Then there will most of the time be a part named **What Happened?** explaining the concept behind the code we made you type. This two parts, **Quick and Dirty** and **What Happened?** are the core of the lesson.

We may then provide additional exercice to do. We encourage you to do some of them. If they are too hard, you can let them aside and come back later. But you will have to do them. They will help you understand what you did. If they seem to hard, feel free to contact us or search for help on the internet. In particular, Elixir have a nice community on Slack or on IRC. (( link to add)). There is also a forum. (another link)

Finally, we will provide a **In details** part that will explain more in depth what are the concept of the lesson. This part is not required to be read. It may be complex or talk about things you don't understand yet. Don't feel bad if you don't read it, it is completely normal. And it is not necessary to finish that course.
